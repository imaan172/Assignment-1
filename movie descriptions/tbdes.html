        <h4>Movie Description</h4>
        <p>Inspired by Stephen King's short story, The Boogeyman is about how a grieving family comes together to fight off a demon. Boogeyman is an imaginary creature who targets children, and that is pretty much how the monster in the film operates. The Harper family struggled to keep themselves together after the loss of Cara in a car accident. Cara’s elder daughter, Sadie, refused to let go of her mother’s belongings and wore one of Cara’s dresses to school. She wanted to hold on to whatever little her mother had left behind. Sadie was always troubled to think about how she never got the chance to bid her mother goodbye. Sadie’s younger sister, Sawyer, was too little to process the loss. But she had developed a fear of darkness and always kept the lights in her room on. After the death of his wife, Will chose not to express the emotional turmoil he was going through, and that created a distance between him and his daughters.<br><br>
            The Boogeyman can be interpreted as a metaphorical representation of grief and pain. The Billings were grieving the loss of their infant when they believed that the monster entered their family, and the same happened with the Harpers. The monster was a reminder of the aching pain that disturbed all the family members. The basement consisted of all of Cara’s belongings, and that night Sadie was forced to burn everything down. To think of it, the act was a way to recover from the tragedy. To finally let go of the person who was already gone. Burning down the basement was how the Harpers learned to take a step forward. The family could only heal once they were together; after all, one needs nothing more than companionship and the support of their loved ones to cope with a devastating occurrence. The monster in the closet is the physical manifestation of unaddressed grief and trauma, and no matter how unsettling it is, at the end of the day, the only way to get rid of the monster is by facing it.
